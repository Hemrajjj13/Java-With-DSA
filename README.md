## About

This repository is focused on combining **Java programming** with **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**.  
My goals are:

- To deepen my understanding of core Java concepts  
- To build and practice data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, etc.)  
- To implement algorithms (sorting, searching, traversal, pathfinding, etc.)  
- To solve real coding problems and challenges  
- To share the code as a reference / portfolio
