# ðŸ§® Java Console Calculator

This is a simple **command-line calculator** written in Java.  
It performs basic arithmetic operations â€” addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus â€” based on user input.

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- Supports the following operations:
  - Addition (`+`)
  - Subtraction (`-`)
  - Multiplication (`*`)
  - Division (`/`)
  - Modulus (`%`)
- Handles invalid operator inputs gracefully.
- Allows continuous operation until the user exits by pressing **`x`** or **`X`**.
- Uses Javaâ€™s `Scanner` class for user input.

## ðŸ§® How It Works
1. The program repeatedly prompts the user to enter an operator.
2. If a valid operator is entered, it asks for two numbers.
3. It performs the selected operation and displays the result.
4. The loop continues until the user types **`x`** or **`X`** to exit.
